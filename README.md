# CellSociety 
Cell Society Team 23: Ashka Stephen, Juan Philippe, Yuxiang He
Due Date: 2.13.2017

Implemented Simulations:
- Simulations: Game of Life, Predator Prey, Fire, Segregation, Slime (see note), and SugarScape (see note).

NOTES:
-SugarScape: General code implementation and basic structure is there. If given more time for this project, functionality would have been simple from here.
-SlimeModel: Basic implementation is there and simulation's initial state works. If given more time, debugging would lead to complete functionality. At this point it does not fully run but structure is easily extendable.
